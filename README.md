# "Data Preprocessing and Transformation Project"

This repository contains a project dedicated to data preprocessing and transformation techniques 
applied to the 'airquality' dataset. The project focuses on several key areas:

    1. Efficient handling of missing values.
    2. Thorough exploration of the datasetâ€™s structure.
    3. Execution of arithmetic and logical operations to ready the data for analysis.

Core tasks include:

    - Removal of NA values in critical variables.
    - Creation of new categorical features.
    - Binning of continuous values into predefined intervals.
